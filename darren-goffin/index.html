      <h2>Darren Goffin</h2>
      <p>Dr Darren Goffin obtained a First Class (Hons) BSc in Pharmacology from the University of Bristol. This was followed by a PhD in the Department of Pharmacology at UCL School of Pharmacy. During this time he carried out work on characterising dopaminergic control of GABA(A) receptor phosphorylation and trafficking in neurons and neuroprogenitor cells. Darren subsequently moved to work in Dr Zhaolan Zhou’s laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, USA) where he began his work on understanding how mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2 lead to behavioural manifestations in Rett syndrome. This work was supported through postdoctoral fellowships received from the International Rett Syndrome Foundation and Philadelphia Children’s Hospital. In 2014, Darren was appointed lecturer in the Departments of Biology and Psychology at the University of York. In 2016, he won the prestigious MRC New Investigator Award.</p>
