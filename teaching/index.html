    Teaching
  </h1>
    
<p>
My teaching vision is that all of my students to graduate with the skills and confidence to walk the path of their choosing.
</p>
 
  <p>
My approach to teaching has crystallised over time. When I first began, I believed that it was my job to deliver new knowledge to students. However, I soon realised that this is not enough. A focus on knowledge acquisition leads to students feeling a lack of purpose, disengagement with the learning process, superficial and transient understanding of the material, and an inability to apply their learning to new problems and challenges in future years. Informed by experience with different cohorts of students, my teaching strategy emerged. I now strive to make every student feel important, challenge and excite students to feel accountable for doing the work of learning, and encourage students to focus less on what they cover in lectures and more on what they discover for themselves. Three principles support my teaching philosophy: accessibility, rigour, and community.
  </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Accessibility. </b></i>Undergraduate modules must be within the academic reach of all of the students. Introductory modules often serve students from different backgrounds, students wishing a single exposure to a field, and students for whom the module is a gateway to higher-level studies. Students will disengage with the material or lose their appetite for future endeavours in the field if the module assumes too much prior knowledge or the learning curve is too steep without an adequate support structure for those less comfortable. If this happens, we all suffer from fewer trained scholars generating new ideas that push us forward.</p>
  <p><i><b>Rigour. </b></i>The desire for modules to be accessible does not mean that they should be easy. I expect no less of students for whom the subject does not come naturally than those who are more comfortable. However, that rigour is only possible if I create appropriate support structures, including weekly Q&A sessions and daily office hours.</p>
  <p><i><b>Community. </b></i> I strive to transform undergraduate modules into communities: a shared experience wherein students know (and are reminded) that they have classmates who also struggle; and, with an appropriate support structure, drive one another to success. I, therefore, instil a sense of community and, in turn, collective accomplishment.</p>
