There are over 7 billion people on this planet. Yet we are all unique. There is no one else like you. Our uniqueness stems from how our genes and experiences effect activity in the brain. Within your brain there are around 100 billion neurons that are engaged in complex electrical and chemical exchanges with one another. As the activity of these neurons change, so do you. We are interested in understanding how specific neurons and neuronal circuits regulate proper brain function and behaviour. In addition, a major focus of our work is understanding how these neuronal circuits are affected in the debilitating neurological disorder Rett syndrome.
