# DNA Ladder Preparation  
  
  
This protocol is for use with 100 bp DNA Ladder [(G210A; Promega)](https://www.promega.co.uk/products/cloning-and-dna-markers/molecular-weight-markers/100bp-dna-ladder/?catNum=G2101).  

A diluted stock is prepared for use.   
10 µl of this diluted ladder is added to the agarose gel (0.65 µg of ladder DNA).  
 
Prepare a diluted stock as follows:

|    Volume (µl)  |             Component             |
| ----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 250             | DNA Ladder                        |
| 83              | Gel Loading Dye, Blue/Orange (6X) |
| 167             | Distilled water                   |
