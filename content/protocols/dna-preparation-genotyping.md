# Preparation of Genomic DNA for Genotyping
  
* Add 600 μl tissue lysis buffer with 3 μl Proteinase K to each tube
* Lyse overnight at 55°C

* Add 200 μl protein precipitation solution. Vortex for 10 secs to thoroughly mix
* Centrifuge at max speed for 3 mins
* Decant supernatant into fresh tube containing 600 μl isopropanol 
* Add 1 µl of glycogen to better visualise pellet
* Invert the tubes >50 times
* Centrifuge for 3 mins at max speed to precipitate DNA. A small white pellet should be visible. Pour off isopropanol

* Add 200 μl of 70% ethanol and invert a few times to wash pellet
* Centrifuge for 3 mins at max speed
* Pellet may be loose. Remove ethanol and air dry for 5 mins

* Ear notch: add 50 μl TE buffer
* Tail: add 200 μl TE buffer

* Hydrate DNA for 1 hour at 65°C
