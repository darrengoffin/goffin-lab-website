# Immunohistochemistry


## Section collection

* Sections should be cut on cryostat and placed into 4 ml of PB + 0.1% Azide at 4°C in a 12 well dish without mesh
* Sections can be stored at 4°C and last > 6 months

## IHC

* Add up to 4 sections per well with mesh 
* Rinse tissue X2 with PBS for 5 mins 
* Soak in PBS+TX for 10 mins  
* Rinse in 10% MeOH (diluted in PBS + TX) for 5 minutes  
* Block using 3% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS for 1 hour at RT 
* Incubate the sections in primary antibody solution at RT for 2 hours (or 4°C overnight)  
	* Note: serum species should match the species used to make the secondary antibodies 
	* Note: If using primary antibody made in goat do not use goat serum

* Wash X3 in PBS for 5 mins  
* Incubate in 2° Ab solution for 2 hours at RT  
* Wash X2 with PBS for 5 mins 
* Incubate with DAPI (1 μg/ml) diluted in PBS for 2 minutes diluted in PBS for 15 minutes
* Wash X1 with PBS for 5 mins 
* Wash X3 with PB for 5 mins 
* Mount onto coverslips 

## Equipment 
* 12 well cell culture dishes coated with Sylgard – these can be washed and reused
* Mesh from Netwell culture dishes – these can be washed and reused

* Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS): Dilute from 10X stock
* PBS + TX: PBS + 0.2% Triton 
* 1° Ab dilution solution: 1% NGS, 0.1% Sodium Azide in PBS + TX 
* 2° Ab dilution solution: 1% NGS in PBS
