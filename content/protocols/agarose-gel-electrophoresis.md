# Agarose Gel Electrophoresis  
  
### *__Prepare 2% Agarose gel__*  

* Measure 3g of agarose
* Add 150 mL of 1xTAE in a microwavable flask
* Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved 
    * Note: Microwave in pulses of 30-45 secs, swirling the flask occasionally as the solution heats up
	* **Note: Caution HOT!!! Agarose can boil over**
* Cool agarose to about 50°C – about 5 mins  

* Add 10 µl of  SYBR Safe (final dilution = 1:15,000)
* Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well combs in place.
	* Note: Pour slowly to avoid bubbles. Any bubbles can be pushed away with a pipette tip.
* Leave for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solidified.  
  
  
### *__Load Samples and Running Agarose Gel__*  

* Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box.
* Fill gel box with 1xTAE until the gel is covered.
* Carefully load 10 µl of [100 bp DNA ladder](/protocols/dna-ladder-100bp/) into the first lane of the gel.
* Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel.
* Run the gel at 150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel.
	* Note: A typical run time is about 20 – 30 minutes.
* Visualise gel
